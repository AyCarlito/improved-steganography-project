### Discussion

Meetings - Once every 2 weeks. Wednesday 12:30

Implement algorithm in any language. Will be using Python

Interesting part of project is lossy compression and improving detectability component rather than capacity

## Second Meeting - 14 Oct 2020

* Meeting Duration: 12:31 - 12:40

### Discussion

Asked how replacement portion of algorithm works. Find which blocks are complex and replace. Have some way to track which blocks have been conjugated and store this conjugation map. 

## Third Meeting - 21 Oct 2020

* Meeting Duration: 12:32-12:47

### Discussion

Showed progress on encoding and decoding algorithms as well as visualisations produced.

Asked which visualisations should be produced.
- Complexity Histogram - Frequency of colour values

Should also implement an automated steganalysis tool to determine if image is stego object or not.
