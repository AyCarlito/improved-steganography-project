# Meetings 

## First Meeting - 2 Oct 2020

* Meeting Duration: 11:00 - 11:06

### Discussion

Meetings - Once every 2 weeks. Wednesday 12:30

Implement algorithm in any language. Will be using Python

Interesting part of project is lossy compression and improving detectability component rather than capacity

## Second Meeting - 14 Oct 2020

* Meeting Duration: 12:31 - 12:40

### Discussion

Asked how replacement portion of algorithm works. Find which blocks are complex and replace. Have some way to track which blocks have been conjugated and store this conjugation map. 

## Third Meeting - 21 Oct 2020

* Meeting Duration: 12:32-12:47

### Discussion

Showed progress on encoding and decoding algorithms as well as visualisations produced.

Asked which visualisations should be produced.
- Complexity Histogram - Frequency of colour values

Should also implement an automated steganalysis tool to determine if image is stego object or not.

## Fourth Meeting - 4 Nov 2020

* Meeting Duration: 17:31-17:37

### Discussion 

Showed improved histogram -> A result of gray coding and variable complexities. 

Asked about steganalysis cases and whether I was missing any. Cases are as follows:
- Stego Object Only
- Known cover and stego
- Known message and stego
- Known algorithm and stego
- Known cover, algorithm and stego
- Known message, algorithm and stego

## Fifth Meeting - 11 Nov 2020

* Meeting Duration: 12:31-12:35

### Discussion 

Will finish automated tool by next week. Then will make a start on JPEG steganography
