Improved Steganography Algorithm Documentation
============================================================

The BPCS steganography algorithm has vulnerabilties that leave hidden payloads suceptible to digital detection. This project implements and evaluates modifications to the algorithm to address these vulnerabilities. 
Additionally, steganographic techniques used in conjunction with JPEG compression are investigated.
