# Timelog

* Improved Steganography Algorithm
* Daniel Hislop
* 2317990H
* Dr Ron Poet

## Guidance

* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

## Week 1

## Week 2 

### 1 Oct 2020

* *0.5 hour* Background reading of relevant research paper
* *0.5 hour* Creation of mindmap outlining initial thoughts of project and direction it should take

### 2 Oct 2020

* *0.5 hour* First meeting with supervisor. Recorded agreed thoughts on direction of project, outlined logistical details such as frequency of meetings. 

## Week 3

### 10 Oct 2020

* *0.5 hour* Created GiHub repository and project file structure
* *0.5 hour* Update markdown files for meetings/timelog and plan
* *2 hours* Start of BPCS implementation. Get images, convert to arrays and slice bitplanes of vessel and secret. 

### 11 Oct 2020

* *2.5 Hours* Seperated existing code into functions. Added function to determine complexity. Added funciton to create 8x8 blocks for each bitplane.

### 12 Oct 2020

* *2.5 Hours* Added tests. Changed directory structure. Changed function to get bitplane array, now makes use of numpy indexing speed.

### 17 Oct 2020

* *5 Hours* Added replacement and conjugation functions. Modified complexity function.

### 18 Oct 2020

* *3 Hours* Started decoding.py. Having problem recovering image. Able to get metadata, but image not being displayed correctly.

### 19 Oct 2020

* *2 Hours* Working encoding and decoding algorithms. Fixed previous day's issue by modifying complexity function. Also improved conugation function to make use of numpy indexing speed. 

### 31 Oct 2020

* *1 Hour* Added command line argparsing. Also added variable complexities (part of improved algorithm)
* *0.5 Hour* Update meeting.md
